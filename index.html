            I am currently studying mechanical engineering at Olin College but I still feel that Cleveland is the center
            of civilization. I follow curiosity and a belief in an inspired and glorious future. Ultimately, I hope to
            work on aerospace, prefabricated construction, and advanced manufacturing technologies, because they are key
            to creating that future. I seek to understand the philosophy of why and what to build, the foundation of

            and the relentless work and practicality necessary to make them work.</h2>

        <h2 id="olin-rocketry">Olin Rocketry</h2>
        <p><img src="Rocket.jpg" alt="Rocket">
            I currently serve as structures lead on Olin Rocketry, a community of students passionate about aerospace
            engineering. Our current focus is the construction of a series of research and development rockets
            progressing in altitude toward a flight into space in 2027.
            To meet this ambitious goal, we are developing a variety of technologies which require refined mechanical
            engineering, and the close integration of mechanical, electrical, aerospace and chemical systems.</p>
        <h4 id="airbrakes">Airbrakes</h4>
        <p>In my first year on Olin Rocketry, I designed a system of mechanical airbrakes, which enabled active control
            of a rocket's altitude. Although not directly related to our ultimate goal, this project provided useful
            experience in integrating mechanical and electrical systems in a package constrained by the form factor,
            payload capacity, and aerodynamic stresses of a rocket.</p>
        <p>The structures team started by generating a variety of concepts and creating sketch models:</p>
        <p><img src="airbrakessketchmodel.jpg" alt="Sketch Model"></p>
        <p>We then performed detailed design of the mechanical system, where I was able to apply my existing knowledge
            of CNC machining and composite manufacturing techniques to design and fabricate lightweight and robust
            components from aluminum and composites. The airbrakes will be driven by a stepper motor controlling a
            1/4-20 lead screw, which drives a set of four-bar linkages, and in turn a pair of aluminum flaps, which fold
            into the fuselage. </p>
        <p>Due to their role as a part of the rocket's structure, the airbrakes incorporate an I-beam style construction
            aluminum construction wrapped in wood and carbon fiber based composites. This resists both the thrust force
            and off axis forces.
            These calculations informed the development of the avionics team's flight control algorithm</p>
        <p><img src="Airbrakes.png" alt="CAD"></p>
        <p>A new experience I gained from this project was the application of analysis to inform a mechanical design
            which would survive large aerodynamic forces, and an electrical system capable of driving it. Through this
            process I learned to apply both hand calculations through free body diagrams, and finite element analysis
            and basic fluid dynamics simulations.</p>
        <h4 id="propulsion">Propulsion</h4>
        <p>The core of any rocket is its motor: Olin Rocketry uses solid fueled motors. The first motor I worked failed
            due to communication errors which led to an overconstraining nozzle. I resolved to gain a more complete
            understanding of rocket propulsion in order to avert future failures. After studying the textbook Rocket
            Propulsion Elements, I am using physics principles to calculate the optimal nozzle and casing design to
            maximize vehicle altitude and motor reliability. After machining a motor for the first time, I saw ways in
            which nozzle retention could be done more effectively am using my extensive machining experience to develop
            a design which is easier to produce using manual machining. </p>
        <p><img src="RocketMotor.png" alt="Motor Cad"></p>
        <h3 id="pulsejet">Pulsejet</h3>
        <p>Sometimes, you just have to do something cool! I worked with two friends to design and build a valved
            pulsejet engine, fueled by propane. Using the inherent resonance of a metal tube to create repeated
            deflagrations, a pulsejet is a simple and inefficient but very high thrust engine. Ours used a set of reed
            valves made from spring steel and mounted in a precision machined valve block. This project gave me valuable
            experience in the process of engineering from scratch: researching past projects, distilling them to
            principles, and using those to calculate an optimal design based on a few parameters. In this case, the
            parameters were 60lbs of thrust, and minimal cost.</p>
        <p><img src="Pulsejetcad.png" alt="CAD"></p>
        <p> I used equations sourced from various studies to parametrically design, and then fabricated it using
            conversational CNC machining, manual machining, and sheet metal working. My initial design for a low effort
            petal style reed valve failed due to the material properties of the spring steel, which would not deflect
            sufficiently to achieve the engine's resonance.</p>
        <p> <img src="pulsejet.jpg" alt="Initial Engine"> </p>
        <p> As a result, I am milling a more complex, v-shaped reed valve design which should provide for better airflow
            and more reliable valve operation.

        <h3 id="k-scale">K-Scale</h3>
        <p>In my work at K-Scale Labs, I designed and built humanoid robots using rapid prototyping. Stompy, our
            humanoid robot, is meant to be manufacturable by either hobbyists or mass manufacturers overseas. To achieve
            these goals, I developed versions using both 3D printing and sheet metal. In the first version I developed,
            I designed a simple gripper and developed a head which would have all of the functions of a household smart
            speaker, allowing Stompy to take instructions by voice, view its environment, and respond using audio or
            visual outputs. </p>
        <p><img src="IMG_20240701_193432580.jpg" alt="First Stompy"></p>
        <p><img src="Gripper.jpg" alt="Gripper"></p>
        <p>I learned audio engineering principles (not unlike those used in the pulsejet) to produce and receive clear
            audio from low cost components despite vibration caused by motors.</p>
        <p><img src="Head.jpg" alt="Head"></p>
        <p>In the second and third variations, I refined the design to incorporate the same capabilities in a smaller
            package. I created conduit channels for power and data wires to run within the moving limbs of the robot,
            and designed satisfying, user friendly connectors for the limbs and battery.</p>
        <p><img src="batterycase1.jpg" alt="Battery Case"></p>
        <p><img src="QuickDisconnectwelder.jpg" alt="Quick Disconnect Designs"></p>
        <p>I incorporated design for manufacturing principles and learned basic industrial design to make a robot which
            would be reliable, aesthetically pleasing, and easy to build for people with no technical experience.</p>
        <p><img src="" alt="Sheet metal stompy"></p>
        <p><img src="FullStompy.jpg" alt="Stompy mini"></p>
        <p>Along the way, I also worked on developing a mobile battery power system and custom battery pack. I also
            researched alternative future actuator designs using multiple PCB stators to achieve a user-friendly form
            factor. In doing so, I gained a knowledge of power electronics and motor design.</p>
        <h3 id="machining">Machining</h3>
        <p>In Ohio, manufacturing is a core part of culture. I started machining in high school, which has given me an
            appreciation for the perspective of people who will have to build what I design. </p>
        <p><img src="hammer.jpg" alt="Hammer"></p>
        <p>Machining has taught me to intuitively understand the qualities of the materials I work with.
            I have learned attention to detail, the essence of craftsmanship, and care for my tools.</p>
        <h3 id="drones">Drones</h3>
        <p><img src="parachute.jpg" alt="Parachute"></p>
        <p>My first drone-related project was a drone-mountable parachute system which I built as part of a research
            project for the Olin Robolab and Draper Labs. I learned the basics of control and filtering algorithms,
            implementing a complementary filter using Arduino and an MPU6050 IMU in order to activate a spring-loaded
            parachute instantaneously, but only if the drone fell out of stable flight conditions.</p>
